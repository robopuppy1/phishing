### Describe a challenge you faced. How did you overcome it? How did you reach out for help? ###

I decided to make a comic and color it by myself, which turned out to be much more difficult then expected. I also had to write the script, making this a lot of work for me. I asked my parents to help provide details about cybersecurity careers and the threat it is, allowing me to overcome the difficulty of the script. However, drawing and coloring all the images was still a major challenge for me.
