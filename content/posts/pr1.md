### Describe a challenge you faced. How did you overcome it? How did you reach out for help? ###

I decided to make a comic, color and write the script by myself, which turned out to be much more difficult and time consuming than I initially expected. I researched topics related to cybersecurity and the careers associated with it. Girls Who Code helped me understand the basics of CSS and HTML which I was able to leverage in building out my project. I reached out to my Dad to help me publish my project web site so it was easily accessible.
