  I made this presentation as part of my Girls Who Code Cybersecurity project.
  I made a short comic as opposed to a detailed website because I hoped people would become more
  interested about Cybersecurity if they read through a fun comic instead of a serious article.
  Hopefully you enjoy the comic and understand more about phishing from this story.
  If you are reading this on a mobile device please click the menu symbol at the top right of the page
